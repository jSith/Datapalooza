G2F 2014 Hybrid Data

Female parents of hybrids were divided in 9 heterotic pools based on genetic
background (Table 2).
Each of the heterotic pools (1-8) were crossed with multiple testers (Table 3).
Each combination of tester and heterotic pool was designated as an ‘experiment’
(Table 4).

Final data included 858 hybrids with approximately 250 hybrids grown at each
Field-location except for Ames, IA, where an attempt was made to plant all
hybrids.  The experiment was a modified form of a split plot design with
individual trials as the whole plot factor arranged in a randomized complete
block design and hybrids as the subplot factor.  The design differed from a
classical split plot because the subplot factor (hybrid) was nested within the
whole plot factor (trial).  In classical split plot designs, whole-plot and sub
-plot factors are cross-classified.

A local check was selected, by the investigator, at each location and one local
check plot was grown within each block within each replicate.  Each hybrid was
assigned a unique hybrid code (located in ‘code’ column of the dataset). 
Hybrid experiments were grown at 21 field-locations with two experiments (NYH1
and NYH2) located geographically on the same farm at Aurora, NY.

Investigators indicated certain plots had been replaced with filler (any
variety of corn used as a placeholder for missing plots) and or certain plots
should be discarded (Table 4).  Columns indicated as Filler may have data in
the data set, but those data are considered unusable by the investigator.  In
addition, some values were identified as being out of range of observable
values and those observations changed to missing values in the final curated
data set with conditions listed in Table 5.  Comments provided by investigators
are provided in Table 6.

                       1. The combine we used did not get test weight data. 
                       So, that column is missing.   2. The day we did the 
                       stand counts it was freezing cold and really hard to be 
                       outside. I did my best on QC the data and in most of the 
                       cases it was easy to figure out what the mistake was; 
                       but as results there are a few missing datapoints.  3. 
                       Sherrie; the technician who did the harvesting send me 
                       the following note: "There are several entries that have 
                       a fairly large moisture difference between reps. We did 
                       harvest rep 1 about a week before rep 2 but that 
                       shouldn’t account for 5+ % difference. We have 
                       experienced that wet plots may leave some residual 
                       moisture that could carry over to the reading for the 
                       next plot(s). Some of this material is just too late for 
                       our growing environment. This information should forward 
                       along with the data as an explanation"

                       population in this field was below our target 
                       population. We started with very low soil moisture 
                       profile (bone dry as the farmers called) due to 
                       prolonged drought from November 2013 to May 26 this 
                       year. The field was watered with a center pivot. We 
                       watered the field before planting and also watered 
                       regularly during the growing season. But the windy 
                       weather and dry soil made it very challenging to 
                       establishing a good stand; and also hurt the root system 
                       in the early stage. As a result; plants were much 
                       shorter than past years; yield was far below our target 
                       yield of 250 bu/ac. 2. You will notice that the plant 
                       counts were very low in the first three ranges which 
                       were located in the south end of the pivot section and 
                       had lower soil due to the winds and no plant protection 
                       from the driveway and also cotton field. 3. Inbred line 
                       test was located inside the field. Low population was 
                       primarily due to the poor seed germination? I am pretty 
                       happy with the inbred data.
