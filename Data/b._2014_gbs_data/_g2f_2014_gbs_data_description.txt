G2F 2014 Genotypic Data.

Genotyping-by-Sequencing libraries for 1,577samples were generated following
the protocol proposed by Elshire et al. 2011, using ApeKI as restriction
enzyme. Cornells Genomic Diversity Facility processed 321 as part of different
public projects, while the rest were sequenced at University of Wisconsin
Biotechnology Center for the GxE project. All samples were sequenced at 96-
plex. 

Genotypes for all samples were called using the Tassel5-GBS Production Pipeline
(Glaubitz et al. 2014 PLoS ONE 9: e90346) with the ZeaGBSv2.7 Production TOPM
(AllZeaGBSv2.7_ProdTOPM_20130605.topm.h5, available at panzea.org). The
pipeline produces information on 955,690 SNPs, approximately half of them do
not segregate for this set of samples. Imputation was performed with FILLIN
(Swarts et al. 2014 Plant Genome 7(3)), using our standard set of maize donor
haplotypes with 8k windows (AllZeaGBSv2.7impV5_AnonDonors8k.tar.gz, available
at panzea.org). The genome coordinates for both imputed and unimputed files are
AGPv2.

There are 2 different GBS files, one with raw data and one with imputed data.
The *.h5 genotype files can only be opened with Tassel5.  The raw genotype file
(raw.h5) contains allele depth information in addition to the un-imputed
genotypes. 

All the samples sequenced up to date (2016-11-09) as part of the 2014, 2015,
and 2016 GxE projects are part of the file. This includes blanks (54) and
repeated checks on each plate. For some inbreds, more than one DNA sample was
sequenced. When multiple samples for one inbred were available, the selection
of which sample would be linked to the phenotypic data was done based on raw
coverage only. We encourage users to perform their own QC and select their own
samples from the bigger file. Additional information about the samples can be
found in the GBS metadata file and it can be used to filter different subsets
of data
